# ToDo-list
Node.js and Express application:
This is a basic Node.js and Express application that sets up a server to listen on port 3000. The application includes two routes, one for the home page and one for a work page, which both display a to-do list. The application uses the EJS view engine to render the to-do lists. The home page route uses the Date object to get the current date and time, and the toLocaleDateString method is used to format the date as a string. The work page simply renders the list EJS template with the listTitle set to "Work List". The application also includes two POST routes to handle form submissions from the home page and the work page, respectively.

HTML file with a heading and paragraph:
This is a simple HTML file that displays a heading and a paragraph. The file does not appear to be related to the Node.js and Express application code provided.

HTML file with footer tags:
This is the closing tags for the HTML body, footer, and html elements. The footer element contains the text "Copyright 2023". It's worth noting that the footer element should typically be placed inside the body element.

HTML file with a link to an external stylesheet:
This is an HTML file that includes a link to an external stylesheet named styles.css located in the css directory. The file likely contains styling rules that will be applied to the HTML elements on the page. The head section of the HTML file also includes standard meta tags for setting the character encoding, specifying compatibility with Internet Explorer, and setting the viewport size. The title tag sets the title of the web page to "To Do List".
